# Autonomous Harvesting of Mango from Orchards Using Drones

## Overview

During my summer internship at NIT Calicut, I had the opportunity to work on Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS/Drone) and their allied technologies. My focus was on integrating and developing advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Computer Vision to enhance drone capabilities.

## Project Description

I contributed to the project **"Autonomous Harvesting of Mango from Orchards Using Drones,"** where we applied cutting-edge techniques to improve the functionality and efficiency of UAS. The goal was to develop a drone capable of autonomously navigating through orchards, identifying and harvesting ripe mangoes.

## My Contributions

### Pathfinding and Obstacle Avoidance

As part of the pathfinding team, I was responsible for developing real-time obstacle avoidance algorithms to navigate the drone from the starting point to the ending point efficiently. This involved:

- **Implementing Algorithms**: I implemented Dijkstra's, A*, and RRT* algorithms for both static and dynamic environments using Python and MATLAB Simulink.
- **Real-Time Navigation**: Ensuring the drone could navigate autonomously in real-time, avoiding obstacles and reaching the target locations efficiently.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Optimizing these algorithms for better performance in complex environments typically found in mango orchards.

### Tools and Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python, MATLAB
- **Software Tools**: MATLAB Simulink, ROS (Robot Operating System)
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi for installation of programs in the drone flight controller
- **Algorithms**: Dijkstra's, A*, RRT*
- **Technologies**: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Computer Vision

## Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to push the boundaries of what drones can achieve in agricultural applications. By integrating advanced algorithms and technologies, I contributed to a system that can potentially revolutionize the way crops are harvested, making the process more efficient and less labor-intensive.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank NIT Calicut and my mentors for providing me with this incredible opportunity to work on such a groundbreaking project. The experience has been invaluable, and I look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I gained to future projects.
